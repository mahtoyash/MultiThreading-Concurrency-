//1: Extending Thread class
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

//2: Implementing Runnable
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}




// FOR ACTUALLLY STARTING THE THREADS
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
        
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t2.start();
    }
}



ExecutorService 
So it is a framework provided by the java concurrency API to manage and execute submitted tasks without the need
to manually manage thread life cycles.
1. it can efficiently reuses a fixed pool of threads to execute tasks, thereby improving the performances by
reducing the overhead of thread of thread creation, especically for asynchronous tasks.
